So… last night I had this AWESOME idea for a new game! It’s the most AMAZING thing you’ve ever seen!

Wanna take a look?

That looks… interesting. I *think* we could build it, but we’re probably going to need some bigger circuit boards.

Don’t worry, I’ve got you covered! I found a whole stash of these bigger boards just gathering dust in the warehouse.

You know, even with these bigger boards it’s still a struggle trying to get everything to fit.

I see you found our beginner boards. My daughter used these to design her first robot.

Hey, these boards are AWESOME! There’s even enough room to engrave my name on them. I’m going to be FAMOUS!
