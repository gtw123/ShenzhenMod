## What does it do?

## Installing

* First, back up your SHENZHEN I/O save files. This is **strongly** recommended as there is a risk that using this mod may corrupt your save files. Your save files are normally located at ```My Documents\My Games\SHENZHEN IO```. Make a copy of this folder and put it somewhere safe.
* Download and unzip the latest release from https://github.com/gtw123/ShenzhenMod/releases
* Run ShenzhenMod.exe
* Follow the steps to install the mod.
