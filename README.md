# ShenzhenMod

A mod for [SHENZHEN I/O](http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/).

## What does it do?

* Adds a new prototyping area (sandbox) to the game which is four times the size of the normal one.
* Increases the maximum simulation speed for the first three test runs and in the sandbox.
* Makes the simulation speed slider a bit wider in the sandbox, for more fine-grained speed control.

## Installing

* First, back up your SHENZHEN I/O save files. This is **strongly** recommended as there is a risk that using this mod may corrupt your save files. Your save files are normally located at ```My Documents\My Games\SHENZHEN IO```. Make a copy of this folder and put it somewhere safe.
* Download and unzip the latest release from https://github.com/gtw123/ShenzhenMod/releases
* Run ShenzhenMod.exe
* Follow the steps to install the mod.
* If successful, you can now run the game as usual. Look for "Prototyping bigger ideas" in the puzzle list, just below "Prototyping new ideas".
* Use middle-click-drag or alt-drag to scroll around the circuit board.

## Upgrading from an earlier version

No need to uninstall or unpatch first: simply run the new installer!

## Building from source

* Clone this repo or download the source.
* Install [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).

* Build.
